# Labb1DesignPatterns
Design patterns assignment

About the task:

This lab is about building a very simple application from scratch that applies some common design patterns. The functionality of the application itself is not of great importance, and we will primarily evaluate whether you have created something on your own and incorporated various design patterns into the structure of the application.

What you need to do:

-  Create an arbitrary console application. The specific functionality does not matter, but as a suggestion, it could be something like a simple ATM, a game like Battleship, or something else. If you want to practice programming, build something more complex; if you just want to complete the task quickly, build something simple.
-  Implement **at least three** of the following design patterns in your code:
    1 Factory Method
    2 Singleton
    3 Adapter
    4 Observer
    5 Strategy
-  Clearly state in a comment at the beginning of your code which design patterns you have implemented.
-  When applying a design pattern in your code, write a comment explaining which design pattern it is.
